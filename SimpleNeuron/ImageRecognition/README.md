# Image Recognition
The first and possibly the simplist application of a neural network is recognising hand writing. Here I use the builtin Tensorflow MNIST dataset to test my Bit Input Neurons.

Below can be seen the number 7 which has been quantised to 0s and 1s for the input to the bit neurons. Further analysis will be done on the threshold for creating this quantised data and how it affects the neural networks performance.
