# Stochastic Layer
This is the main implementation of bitstream layers in TensorFlow.

## Layers
### BitInput
This is the bitstream generator. It takes in a list of floats between 0 and 1 and converts them to bitstreams.

### BitOutput
This is the bitstream integrator. It takes in a list of bitstreams and
